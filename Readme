🧠 Diabetic Retinopathy Detection using CNN & Streamlit
🔍 A deep learning-based web app to detect Diabetic Retinopathy stages from retinal images using CNN.

📌 Project Overview
Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) is a diabetes complication that affects eyes. Early detection is crucial to prevent blindness. This project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify fundus (retina) images into 5 DR stages, and provides a Streamlit-based web app for real-time prediction.

🚀 Features
CNN-based classifier for DR severity detection

Clean UI with image upload and prediction

Works with .png, .jpg, .jpeg images

Pretrained model with .h5 file support

Accuracy, loss graphs & performance metrics

🧠 DR Classification Labels
Label	DR Stage
0	No DR
1	Mild
2	Moderate
3	Severe
4	Proliferative DR
